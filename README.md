# Learning DSA again from scratch since Its been a long time
I'm learning DSA from scratch as I forgot how it all works again.
I'm mainly learning from Youtube.
Data Structures from [Neso Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16P51olKuzk&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRj9lld8sWIUNwlKfdUoPd1Y)
And algorithms from [Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O)
