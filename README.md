# Learning DSA again from scratch since Its been a long time
I'm learning DSA from scratch as I forgot how it all works again.
I'm mainly learning from Youtube.
Data Structures from [Neso Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16P51olKuzk&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRj9lld8sWIUNwlKfdUoPd1Y)
And algorithms from [Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O)

## Starting of with Data Structure First
### Day 4
Learned memory allocation using malloc() calloc() realloc() and free()

### Day 5
Learning About Structures and Functions. Which will be used for later on. Learnt:-
- Structure members as arguments
- Calling structure members by reference
- Structure variable as arguments
- Pointer to a structure as arguments
- Why heap memory is used instead of Stack (stack automataically deallocates memory)
- Returning structure variable from a function
- Returning a pointer to a structure from the function
- Passing array of structures as arguments
- Self referential Structures

### Day 6
Learning about Singly Linked List.
- How to add node in a single link list
- Inserting data at the end of the list
- Printing the available data on the list
- Inserting Data at the beginning of the list
