# Learning DSA again from scratch since Its been a long time
I'm learning DSA from scratch as I forgot how it all works again.
I'm mainly learning from Youtube.
Data Structures from [Neso Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16P51olKuzk&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRj9lld8sWIUNwlKfdUoPd1Y)
And algorithms from [Abdul Bari](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O)

## Starting of with Data Structure First
### Day 1-3
(Forgot to add this) I was learning some basics about Data Strxuthres before starting on code implementation.
- Data Structures and Data Types
- Asymptotic Notation
- Asymptotic Analysis
- Pointers and its types

### Day 4
Learned memory allocation using malloc() calloc() realloc() and free()

### Day 5
Learning About Structures and Functions. Which will be used for later on. Learnt:-
- Structure members as arguments
- Calling structure members by reference
- Structure variable as arguments
- Pointer to a structure as arguments
- Why heap memory is used instead of Stack (stack automataically deallocates memory)
- Returning structure variable from a function
- Returning a pointer to a structure from the function
- Passing array of structures as arguments
- Self referential Structures

### Day 6
Learning about Singly Linked List.
- How to add node in a single link list
- Inserting data at the end of the list
- Printing the available data on the list
- Inserting Data at the beginning of the list

### Day 7
Continued Learning on Singly Linked List.
- Possible errors occuring at insertion at the start
- Error on calling by value instead of head at `add_beg()` instead of `head = add_beg()`and removing `head=ptr` and  `return head` at `add_beg()` function
- Fix error by passing address of head eg. `add_beg(&head, data)
- Modify `add_beg` by making the `*head` pointer to a double pointer eg. `add_beg(**head, ...)`
- Inserting data at a certain position

### Day 8
Only did deletion of first node for today. (lot of work)
- need to fix program error at insertion at position

### Day 9
Continued on Singly Linked list
- Deletion at end of the node (last node)
- Fixed Day 8 issue
- Deletion at end using a single pointer

### Day 10
Comtinued
- Deletion at certain position in the List

### Day 11
Took an off day. Studied about PCA instead

### Day 12
Continued Linked List
- Deletion of entire Linked List
- Reversing Linked List

### Day 13
Took a day off
